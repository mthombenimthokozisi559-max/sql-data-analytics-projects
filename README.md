# Project Title
WORLD LIFE EXPECTANCY.

## Problem Statement
How do economic and health-related factors such as GDP and BMI relate to life expectancy across countries over time?

## Data Description
The dataset contains country-level life expectancy data over multiple years, along with associated variables such as GDP, BMI, and population metrics. The data was used to analyze global health trends and disparities between countries.


## Data Cleaning
The dataset contained missing and duplicated values, particularly across country-year combinations. These issues were resolved using joins and aggregation techniques to ensure each country-year record was complete and accurate before analysis.

## Analysis Performed
Calculated average life expectancy by country, comparing minimum and maximum life expectancy using the metric of life expectancy growth over time. 
Grouped countries by GDP level and analyzed BMI trends relative to life expectancy.

## Key Insights
Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy.
Life expectancy has increased globally over time, though unevenly.
Below-average BMI is often associated with lower life expectancy.
Economic disparities strongly correlate with health outcomes.

## Business Implications
The analysis highlights the strong relationship between economic conditions and population health. Policymakers and global health organizations can use these insights to prioritize healthcare investment and nutritional support in lower-income countries to reduce life expectancy gaps.
